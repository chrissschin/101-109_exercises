UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM IMPORTANT
    will save you time
    small problems are more explicit take shorter time
    large problems arent as explicit

Take notes on the problem
example:

input:
    - blah balh
output:
    - should out put this

make examples / test cases
    - test cases help you understand the problem.
    - allows you to verify your solution.
    - edge cases
        - how do i handle (nil/null, [], {})  ??? depends on requirement
        - data types like strings, arrays
        - uppercase / lowercase


ASK QUESTIONS TO VERIFY YOUR UNDERSTANDING

** lets say input doesnt match requirement. since it wasn't asked. You look for potential edge cases. **
